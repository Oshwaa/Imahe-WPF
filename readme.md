# Photo Sorting Desktop App (WPF)

## Overview

This project is a Windows desktop application for sorting photos using WPF and OpenCV with Python. It leverages YOLOv3 for object detection, enhancing the accuracy of the photo sorter by detecting objects in images, even those with significant blur. This ensures that images containing objects, regardless of their quality, are classified correctly, improving the overall effectiveness of the sorting.
